## Introduction

Have you ever been on a trip with friends or family and struggled to manage expenses and split bills? We have all faced this problem. Recently, we went on a trip to Haflong, and during the trip, multiple members were responsible for paying various bills. We were keeping a log of each transaction to finally resolve the calculations. As the number of transactions grew, the calculations became increasingly tedious and difficult to resolve. That's when we decided to create this project.

Our web application serves as a platform for storing and managing expense details, simplifying the process of resolving transactions, and minimizing the overall number of transactions required. We knew that by using data structures and algorithms, we could reduce the number of transactions to a minimum, making it easier for everyone involved.

## Features

- **Expense Management:** Keep track of all expenses, who paid, and who owes what.
- **Automatic Bill Splitting:** Our algorithm minimizes the number of transactions needed to settle the expenses.
- **Review Past Trips:** Access expense information from past trips.
- **Email Reminders:** Send email reminders for outstanding payments.
- **User Authentication:** Securely manage your expenses with user authentication.
- **Real-time Updates:** Get real-time updates on expenses and balances.

What sets our project apart is that we actively use it ourselves for trips and group payments. Although there are a few remaining bugs that need to be resolved, we are also considering implementing new features to enhance its functionality.

## Tech Stack

Our web application is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Express.js (Node.js framework)
- **Authentication:** Firebase
- **Database:** MongoDB

## How to Use

1. Sign up or log in to the application.
2. Create a new trip and add expenses.
3. Invite friends to join the trip.
4. The application will automatically calculate and minimize the number of transactions needed to settle expenses.
5. Review past trips and access expense information.
6. Send email reminders for outstanding payments.
